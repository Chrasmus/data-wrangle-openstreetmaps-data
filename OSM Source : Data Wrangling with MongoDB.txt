The OSM used here is covering the City of Aarhus, Jutland, Denmark, Europe (6.8 MB zipped, 125.9 MB as XML):

URL: https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.mapzen.com/aarhus_denmark.osm.bz2

Example.osm (2.3 MB) URL: https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=16/56.1185/10.1535


I have chosen this city because I have lived here for some decades now, and I am therefore quite familiar with the names and places.
